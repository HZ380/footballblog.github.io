        <h2>How does Matt Eberflus still have a job?</h2>
        <p>By Zain | November 24, 2024</p>
        <p>How does he do it? How does Matt Eberflus and the Chicago Bears find more humiliating ways to lose a game and still manage to stick together?</p>
        <p>Eberflus, who started his tenure with high hopes, has seen his team's performance decline over the past few seasons. Keep in mind, the last two head coaches for the Bears have been fired the same year they drafted a quarterback (John Fox & Matt Nagy). I wouldn't be surprised of Eberflus is next on the chopping block.</p>
        <p>Every decision he's made in these past few weeks has lead the Bears from legitimate NFC threat to bottomfeeder. The Hail Mary from Washington, the embarassing loss to Arizona, the blocked field goal by Green Bay, and the overtime mess against Minnesota. It's been downhill for Chicago for five straight weeks.</p>
        <p>Get this man off the field. For the greater good.</p>
