        <h2>The Snow Globe</h2>
        <img src="snowglobe.jpg" alt="Snow Globe" class="article-image">
        <p>We had a snow game in Cleveland, as two AFC North rivals, the Steelers and Browns, went at it on Thursday night. Despite a seemingly easy game for Pittsburgh, Mike Tomlin reverted to 2018 form and decided to play down to his competition, leading to a 24-19 win for the Browns.</p>
        
        <h2>Mama Mia!</h2>
        <img src="mamamia.jpg" alt="Mama Mia" class="article-image">
        <p>Daniel Jones is gone, so it's time for Tommy DeVito! ...or not, considering he got injured during the Bucs-Giants game. But with or without DeVito on the field, I seriously don't think this game wouldn't have still ended 30-7 in favor of the Buccaneers.</p>
        
        <h2>Star Performances (or the Lack Thereof)</h2>
        <img src="thestar.jpg" alt="Star" class="article-image">
        <p>Lamar Jackson showed up for the Ravens, proving once again that he's not just playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers - he's playing 3D chess. The Chargers once again fail to take advantage of the gobs of oppurtunity handed to them. Thanks to Quentin Johnston's nonexistant hands, Baltimore wins 30-23.</p>
        
        <h2>Coaching Catastrophe's</h2>
        <img src="coaching.jpg" alt="Coaching" class="article-image">
        <p>The Bears, Jaguars and Bengals have one thing in common: head coaches that somehow still have their jobs. Matt Eberflus, Doug Pederson, and Zac Taylor have had abysmal coaching performances dating back to last season, and now they've found themselves on some hot seats.</p>
        
        <h2>Injuries & Drama</h2>
        <img src="injuries.jpg" alt="Injuries" class="article-image">
        <p>Looking at San Francisco and Detroit's rosters, injuries seem to be a major warning sign for their coaching and medical staff. Somehow, Detroit has managed to stay as a one-loss team this season.</p>
        
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <img src="bearsloss.jpg" alt="Bears Loss" class="article-image">
        <p>And now we can look ahead to Thanksgiving. Football and turkey, an American classic. We'll get you set up with the preview and predictions on Wednesday.</p>
